    n = int(input())
    student_marks = {}
    for _ in range(n):
        #assign the first value to name and all the second value to line (*line)
        name, *line = input().split()
        scores = list(map(float, line))
        student_marks[name] = scores
    query_name = input()

Input number of students:
python
Copy code
n = int(input())
This line prompts the user to enter a number (presumably the number of students) and then converts that number from a string to an integer.

Initialize empty dictionary:
python
Copy code
student_marks = {}
Here, you're initializing an empty dictionary. This dictionary will be used to store each student's name as a key and their list of scores as the associated value.

Input student names and scores:
python
Copy code
for _ in range(n):
    name, *line = input().split()
    scores = list(map(float, line))
    student_marks[name] = scores
This loop will run n times (once for each student).

name, *line = input().split(): The user is expected to input a student's name followed by their scores, separated by spaces. The .split() function breaks this input into a list of strings. The first string (the student's name) goes to the name variable, while the rest (the scores) go to the line list.

scores = list(map(float, line)): This line converts each string score in the line list to a floating-point number. For example, if line was ['90', '80', '70'], scores would become [90.0, 80.0, 70.0].

student_marks[name] = scores: Here, you're adding an entry to the student_marks dictionary where the key is the student's name and the value is their list of scores.

Input query name:
python
Copy code
query_name = input()
This line prompts the user to input a student's name. The goal is to find out the average score for this particular student.

Calculate mean for the given query name:
python
Copy code
scores = student_marks[query_name]
mean_score = sum(scores) / len(scores)
Here, you first retrieve the list of scores associated with the query_name from the student_marks dictionary. Then, you compute the mean (average) of these scores by dividing their sum by the number of scores.

Print the mean score:
python
Copy code
print("{:.2f}".format(mean_score))
This line prints the mean_score rounded to two decimal places.

Example Execution:
Let's run through an example for better clarity:

Input:

Copy code
2
John 90 80 70
Jane 85 90 95
John
Output:

Copy code
80.00
Here's what happens:

We've 2 students.
John has scores of 90, 80, and 70.
Jane has scores of 85, 90, and 95.
We want to know John's average score. The program calculates it as (90 + 80 + 70) / 3 = 240 / 3 = 80.00 and then prints that result.
