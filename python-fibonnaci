# Lambda function to cube a number
cube = lambda x: x**3

# Function to return a list of Fibonacci numbers
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_series = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        fib_series.append(a)
      The line a, b = b, a + b swaps a with b and updates b to be the sum of the old a and b. This is done in one step, making it efficient.
        a, b = b, a + b
    return fib_series
